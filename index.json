I ditched Google a long time ago and had been using DuckDuckGo but felt it was time to roll my own solution. One that doesn’t involve any cookies, no tracking on page, and no tracking via the links in results.\nSearXNG Enter, SearXNG - a privacy-respecting, open metasearch engine. I went and installed Searx on my own server and I’ll show you how. But first, why?\nSearx aggregates results from a various search services and databases. Users are neither tracked nor profiled.\nWhen you search a term, Searx reaches out to sites such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Mojeek, Wikipedia, Tinyeye, Archive, Yahoo… you get the picture. There’s quite a few (plethora?) and they can be turned off and on in preferences to help fine tune your results.\nWhy Searx? Searx prevents Google and other search engines from building a profile on you With no profile, search results are generally aggregated rather than served in an echo chamber Searx has no ads, no tracking, and no passing of your data to other sevrices including the linked results you’re clicking Search results are aggregated to Searx’s IP address rather than Google seeing your home IP Installing SearXNG Go to Linode I installed this on my own web server at Linode for $5/month. Set yours up on a Debian/Ubuntu server.\nGet docker After the server is spun up, jump on in there via SSH and run the ol'\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y I messed with installing via a few different install methods but found docker to be the easiest and quickest.\nsudo apt install docker.io -y Then we install Docker Compose\nsudo apt install docker-compose -y Pick a domain name You could run your Searx install straight from the IP address but that’s just not as fun as using your own cute cool domain name. For extra privacy points, use Njalla (famously the most trusted domain privacy provider in the world) to purchase your domain.\nYou’ll need to point your cute cool domain to Linode. Linode makes this quite easy so don’t fret.\nInstall Searx Back on your server, go to a directory to which you want to install Searx.\ncd /usr/local Then clone Searx from it’s github repository. Linode has git pre-installed, if I recall correctly. If your server doesn’t have git then install with these commands. If you do have git then just use the second command.\nsudo apt install git git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git Now, enter the directory you just created with your git clone command.\ncd searxng-docker If you’re following along you’re now in /usr/local/searxng-docker and in that directory is one hidden file we need to edit and that is .env.\nvim .env There are two lines to edit at the top (be sure to delete the # preceding each line)\nSEARXNG_HOSTNAME=yourdomain.xyz\nLETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=youremail@xyz.com\nThe first line is telling search the domain it’s on. The second line is so that Searx can automagically set your domain up with a Let’s Encrypt SSL file.\nThis next line creates a random key within Searx for security purposes.\nsed -i \u0026#34;s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g\u0026#34; searxng/settings.yml Launch your Searx engine Let’s bring it all online from within the /usr/local/searxng-docker directory. The -d runs Searx in the background as a daemon.\nsudo docker-compose -d Now, open your browser and go to your cute cool domain name. Then be proud of the fact that you have reclaimed your autonomy from whichever search engine you had been using.

Stop giving out your personal phone and email address. Instead, use unique ones for each area of your life. Compartmentalize your life so that your banking/finance life, social media life, and shopping life do not intermingle. Phone numbers Use MySudo to obtain unique phone numbers. I subscribe to the 3 phone number plan: one number for Banking/Finance, one for Social Media, and one for Shopping profiles. I don’t utilize the other services that are included with MySudo, only the phone numbers. Email addresses Create a new encrypted email address at Proton Mail - Free or Paid. No service should ever know this email address. (My Proton Mail referral link.) Use Simple Login to create unique email addresses for every website and service you use. Forward these to your Proton Mail. Simple Login is the only website that should know your Proton Mail. For increased privacy/control, you can self-host Simple Login on your own server and/or use your own domain name for your Simple Login addresses. Web Browser [!todo] I need to write more for this section and explain how to browse more privately\nFor a ready-to-go solution, use LibreWolf which is a hardened version of Firefox. Use the Arkenfox approach to fine-tune the hardening of Firefox yourself. Firefox, by default now, uses containers to help you compartmentalize your online activities. Cookies and activities in one container are not accessible to websites in other containers. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers add-on adds a more convenient GUI to managing these containers. For example, use containers Work, Banking, Shopping, Social Media with applicable websites. When you close your web browser configure it to delete all cookies, browser history, site data, etc. This is done by default in LibreWolf, and one of the steps you should take if hardening Firefox yourself. Browse Anonymously [!todo] Expand this section\nVPNs (virtual private networks). Not really necessary since https is the current standard for websites. When you’re visiting websites via https (LibreWolf and Arkenfox defaults) your traffic is already encrypted so you don’t need a VPN to hide that traffic. What a VPN does provide is an IP other than the one assigned by your ISP. If you do want a VPN, go with Mullvad since they ask for no personal information and payments can be made with bitcoin. Another thing I like about them is that they do not pay sponsorships to any “influencers”. Tor (The Onion Network). If you want anonymity, tor is the way to go because your traffic is encrypted and is passed through 3 different locations before arriving at the website you wish. Really good write-up on Tor vs VPN Spend with Privacy Your bank and credit card companies can see where you spend your money. Rather than spending directly from these institutions, use a service such as Privacy which acts as a proxy. Privacy also gives you more control of how your financial data. (My Privacy.com referral link.) I get that this is basically off-loading trust of your bank to trust of Privacy. However, I feel the benefits of control of how other websites/services see and access my financial data is a net benefit. Even More Financial Privacy [!todo] I need to write more on how to best obtain and spend bitcoin.\nUse bitcoin.
